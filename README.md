# Forkio-Step-Project 

## Tasks for Kamal

Design the header of the website with the top menu, including the dropdown menu for small screen resolutions.

Design the “People Are Talking About Fork” section


## Tasks for Jeyhun

Design the “Revolutionary Editor” block. The buttons should resemble the ones shown in the top right corner (you can take all the SVG icons from there and download the
corresponding styles used on GitHub).

Design the “Here is what you get” section.

Design the “Fork Subscription Pricing” section. The third element in the price block should always be "highlighted" and larger than the others (not on click/hover, but
statically).
